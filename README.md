# ICS3U - Computer Science CPT

### Game Title
Describe your game here.

### Group members:
- Caylie
- Selena
- Elena
- Sonia

---

### Rules
You can use AI and StackOverflow *ONLY IF*, using comments, you differentiate between your code and someone else's code. You can also explain how you modified someone else's code.

If your group doesn't pull their weight, I will make adjustments in the **End-product** sections so it won't affect you as drastically.

## Submission
If you are in a group, only one person will sumbit on behalf of the entire group.

### Promo Video
Each group is to submit one promo video one minute in length. If your game is exceptional, I will use this video in a YouTube playlist and portions of it on social media. Please ensure you use first names only and **don't mention any personal information**.

### Code explanation video
Each group member is to submit a five minute explanation of their own code and how it works. You must find examples of each of the topics in the requirements. If you have too many to show, just show your best work. The video's filename *must* include your full name.

**Please note:** The code explanation video is supposed to be an explanation of your code and how it works. You must use technical language to show me you know what these concepts are. This is not a video where you only say "here is a function I wrote". See the sub-topics under the requirements for key words you should know and use.

### Suggestions:
- For **text-based** games:
    - make use of the [Extended ASCII Characters](https://www.lookuptables.com/text/extended-ascii-table)
    - You can also print out with [color and font styling](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/287871/how-do-i-print-colored-text-to-the-terminal).
- For **Pygame**:
    - Checkout my [Pygame Tutorial Site](https://mrgallo.github.io/fundamentals/pygame/index.html) and the [Pygame Cheat Sheet](https://mrgallo.github.io/fundamentals/pygame/pygame-cheatsheet.html).
